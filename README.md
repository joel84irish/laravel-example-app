# Install New Laravel App

composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

# SSL setup

In the ssl folder under `docker/nginx`, create a self-generated certificate as follows;

```
mkdir ssl
cd ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ssl/nginx.key -out ssl/nginx.crt
```

This should generate two files, `nginx.crt` and `nginx.key`

# In the project folder run the following;

`docker-compose up -d` This will build the images and run the containers in the background.

The application should be accessible at https://127.0.0.1

# To make the images as small as possible

路 I used multi-stage builds to reduce the final image size, by using multiple docker files.

路 I used Alpine Linux as the base image.

路 Minimize layers by combining commands in the Dockerfile.

路 I remove unnecessary files and dependencies.
